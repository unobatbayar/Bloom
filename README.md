# Bloom
London Fintech Week 2019 Hackathon, Team Bloom

Everything has been done in a single night with a lot of coffee.

How to access:
```
1) Launch your XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
2) Clone the repository and copy it to your htdocts folder
3) Go to localhost in your browser
```
This is only a half of the Hackathon project. API and Telegram Chatbot with Mobile calling needs to be uploaded here from  Bach Adylbekov.

It's just prototype, it's always subject to change, rebase, and even change stack.
Next step: I need to expand my stack heavily with React.js, AWS, REST APIs and TenserFlow.
